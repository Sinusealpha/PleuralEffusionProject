A simple analyzer of thoracentesis test for physicians

i was confused about how to memorize thoracentesis (i will explain it in the next lines) test values and i wrote a code based on its algorithm and not only i memorized it very well :) but also i finally made my first public repository and i'm more than happy! :)

let's dive into this simple project with some useful links...

-- definition of thoracentesis: "Thoracentesis is a procedure used to obtain a sample of fluid from the space around the lungs, called the pleural space. This fluid is called pleural fluid and normally exists only as a thin layer in the area between the lungs and chest wall."

hope you find it useful and also inspiring to write your own codes based on medical algorithms (that is maybe helpful for you as it was for me)! :)
