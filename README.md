A simple analyzer of thoracentesis test for physicians

i was confused about how to memorize thoracentesis (i will explain it in the next lines) test values and i wrote a code based on its algorithm and not only i memorized it very well :) but also i finally made my first public repository and i'm more than happy! :)

let's dive into this simple project with some useful links...

-- definition of thoracentesis: "Thoracentesis is a procedure used to obtain a sample of fluid from the space around the lungs, called the pleural space. This fluid is called pleural fluid and normally exists only as a thin layer in the area between the lungs and chest wall."

hope you find it useful and also inspiring to make your own codes based on medical algorithms! :)
